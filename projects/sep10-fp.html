            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about how technology has affected our daily jobs. The purpose of this project is to show how technology has been introduced and affected different fields of work throughout the ages. </p>
            <p>For my project, I made a website about animation using HTML, CSS, and Github. This <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zcf0Yoo9nTZ8Sn30AYYEbmQ6-Qul6nV0q1_bl3ocEyc/edit#">blog</a> will walk through my process of independently studying the introduction of technology into animation throughout time and making the website.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Most of my challenges was from the coding process of the website. As I had ideas for the website that was beyond what I could do currently so I had quite a bit of trouble doing what I imagined. Another challenge would come from my presentations as I was having trouble getting things out around the expo with judges compared to my inclass presentation, most likely because I was more familiar with my my classmates seeing as we have been classmates for almost a whole school year unlike compared to the judges and many who stopped by that I didn't know.</p>
            <h3>Takeaway</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stick to what you can handle and only try to go past that once you completed everything</li>
                <li>Have more confidence in your work if you've put a lot of effort into it</li>
                <li>Don't take presentation lightly as once its time it gets more nerve racking</li>
            </ul>
