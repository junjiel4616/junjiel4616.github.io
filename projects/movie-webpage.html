            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Project</h1>
            <p>"The Body Borrower" was a fictional movie webpage me and my partner Piage made together. It was mainly for a movie project where we had to decide on genres and then implement it into a movie story format for SEP that we had to do with each other.</p>
            <p>We decided to make a movie webpage with the horror, action, and fantasy genre in mind.</p>
            <p>A difficulty we ran into during the project was the lining up of our paragrpah and our images side by side and also trying to make the paragraphs and images stay the same throughout different devices. We tried many things but we couldn't seem to line up the images and text exactly and also we couldn't keep them next to each other throughout different devices. After a while more of trial and erors we can to the conclusion that this type coding was well beyond what was required for our first project and that as we spend more time with html and css we would soon be able to fix our current problems. But of now we would have to wait. So the takeaway would be that you shouldn't try to rush beyond your skill level and just take things 1 step at a time.
